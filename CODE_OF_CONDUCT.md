Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
====================================

Our Pledge
----------

Our community is built on the principles of free speech and open
dialogue. We believe that everyone has the right to express their
opinions and ideas, regardless of their background, political beliefs,
or views on any subject. We value diversity of thought, and consider
censorship to be an abhoance, and violation of basic human rights and
dignity.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Public or private harassment, including attempting to "cancel" members.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Unprovoked harassment, and trolling.

We expect all members of our community to engage in respectful and
thoughtful discussions, even when they disagree. While we value
freedom of speech, we also expect members to take responsibility for
their words and actions. This means that if you make a provocative or
inflammatory statement, you should be prepared to defend your views
and engage in open and honest dialogue with others, even if they
disagree with you. Using claims of victimization to shield yourself
from criticism or avoid accountability is not acceptable.

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, 

In particular, we do not tolerate threats of violence, doxing,
swatting, or any other actions that put individuals at risk of
physical harm or emotional distress. These behaviors are not only
unacceptable, but also violate the principles of free speech and
expression, as they seek to intimidate or silence others through fear
and intimidation.
